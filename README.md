Audio data transcription

The ErrorRateCalculation.py file contains the main functions for calculating WER (Word Error Rate) – substitution, deletion, and insertion errors, Spelling mistakes, and Technical terms missing from transcription files. To compute the error for any set of audio transcription files, you need to run the main.py script, which uses these functions.

All required Python packages are listed in the requirements.txt file.

You need to have three types of files and all of them should be text files.

The transcription ground truth file
The machine-generated (or human-generated) transcription file
The technical terms list file
